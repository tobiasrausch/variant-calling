Chromothripsis in a Cancer Sample
=================================

In this practical we will analyze germline and somatic structural variants (SVs) of a Chromothripsis sample from this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22265402). The anonomyzed data has been downsampled to chr2 to speed up all analysis hereafter. The alignment file of the tumor genome is called tumor.bam and the alignment file of the control genome is called control.bam.
