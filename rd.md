Disovering a Causative Mutation in a Rare Disease Patient
=========================================================

This practical provides an introduction into variant discovery and genotyping. We will cover single-nucleotide variants, short insertions and deletions (InDels) and large structural variants. All data of this practical has been anonomyzed and subsampled to speed up the analyses. We will start with a [rare disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23999272) case that we analyzed in 2012. This infant of consanguineous parents suffered from severe combined immunodeficiency and the details are described in this [publication](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23561803).
